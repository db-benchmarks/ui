## Intro

NYC taxi rides is probably the most commonly used benchmark in the area of data analytics.

It started with [Todd W. Schneider](https://toddwschneider.com/) deciding to prepare the collection [first in 2015](https://toddwschneider.com/posts/analyzing-1-1-billion-nyc-taxi-and-uber-trips-with-a-vengeance/) to analyze 1.1 billion NYC Taxi and Uber Trips. Then [Mark Litwintschik](https://tech.marksblogg.com/) continued by testing [lots of databases and search engines](https://tech.marksblogg.com/benchmarks.html) using the data collection.

Now we at https://db-benchmarks.com/:
* have [dockerized preparation of the data collection](https://github.com/db-benchmarks/db-benchmarks/tree/main/tests/taxi/load) to make it easier to use
* made it available as a part of the most transparent and [open source database benchmarks suite](https://github.com/db-benchmarks/db-benchmarks).

## Data collection

The data collection constitutes 1.7B taxi and for-hire vehicle (Uber, Lyft, etc.) trips originating in New York City since 2009. Most of the [raw data](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) comes from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission.

The data collection record includes a lot of different attributes of a taxi ride:
* pickup date and time
* coordinates of pickup and dropoff
* pickup and dropoff location names
* fee and tip amount
* wind speed, snow depth
* and many other fields

It can be used mostly for testing analytical queries, but it also includes a couple of full-text fields that can be used to test free text capabilities of databases.

The whole list of fields and their data types is:

```json
       "properties": {
         "vendor_id": {"type": "keyword"},
         "pickup_datetime": {"type": "date", "format": "epoch_second"},

```

## Databases

So far we have made this test available for 3 databases:
* [Clickhouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse) - a powerful OLAP database,
* [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) - general purpose "search and analytics engine",
* [Manticore Search](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/manticoresearch/) - "database for search", Elasticsearch alternative.

{{% embed file="../about-needed-settings" %}}

* Clickhouse: [no tuning](https://github.com/db-benchmarks/db-benchmarks/blob/main/tests/taxi/init), just `CREATE TABLE ... ENGINE = MergeTree() ORDER BY id` and standard [clickhouse-server](https://github.com/db-benchmarks/db-benchmarks/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) docker image.
* Elasticsearch: here to make it fair to compare with the other databases we [had to help Elasticsearch](https://github.com/db-benchmarks/db-benchmarks/blob/main/tests/taxi/es/logstash_tuned/template.json) by:
  - letting it make 32 shards: (`"number_of_shards": 32`), otherwise it couldn't utilize the CPU which has 32 cores on the server, since as [said](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/size-your-shards.html#single-thread-per-shard) in Elasticsearch official guide "Each shard runs the search on a single CPU thread".
  - `bootstrap.memory_lock=true` since as said on https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html#_disable_swapping it needs to be done for performance.
  - the docker image is [standard](https://github.com/db-benchmarks/db-benchmarks/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)
* Manticore Search is also used in a form of [their official docker image + the columnar library they provide](https://github.com/db-benchmarks/db-benchmarks/blob/main/docker-compose.yml):
  - as well as with Elasticsearch we [also use](https://github.com/db-benchmarks/db-benchmarks/blob/main/tests/taxi/manticore/generate_manticore_config.php) 32 shards in a form of 32 plain indexes
  - and we use Manticore columnar storage since comparing Manticore's default row-wise storage vs Clickhouse's and Elasticsearch's columnar storages would be not fair on such a large data collection.
  - we added `secondary_indexes = 1` to the config which enables secondary indexes while filtering (when loading data that's built anyway). Since Elasticsearch uses secondary indexes by default and it's fairly easy to enable the same in Manticore it makes sense to do it. Unfortunately in Clickhouse user would have to make quite an effort to do the same, hence it's not done, since it would then be considered a heavy tuning which would then require further tuning of the other databases which would make things too complicated and unfair.

## Queries

The queries are mostly analytical queries that do filtering, sorting and grouping. We've also included one full-text query:
{{% code file="../../db-benchmarks/tests/taxi/test_queries" language="json" %}}

## Results

You can find all the results on the [results page](/) by selecting "Test: taxi". {{% embed file="../about-results" %}}

**Unlike other less transparent and less objective benchmarks we are not making any conclusions, we are just leaving screenshots of the results here:**
